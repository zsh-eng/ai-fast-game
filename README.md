# AI Zero to Hero

## Motivation

I wanted to get a basic understanding of AI.

Decided around the middle of March that it's important to get a basic understanding of transformers and LLMs.

Background:

I remember almost nothing from these courses.

- Linear algebra: Aug 2022
- Calculus: Jan 2023

- Graph search, adversarial search: Feb 2025

## Log

Friday (20 March) - Wednesday:

- [X] Bayes Networks: Exact and Sampling
- [X] Markov Chains

Note: Thursday midterm for COMP 560 AI class.

Thursday - Friday:

- [x] CS188 Neural networks
- [X] Multi-armed bandits
- [X] Reinforcement learning I and II

Saturday:

- [x] Neural network + gradient descent (micrograd)
- [x] Makemore - bigram and single layer neural network

Sunday:

Exercises:

- [x] E01: train a trigram language model,
    i.e. take two characters as an input to predict the 3rd one.
    Feel free to use either counting or a neural net.
    Evaluate the loss; Did it improve over a bigram model?

- [x] Makemore - MLP

Monday

- [x] Makemore - Backpropagation

Tuesday

- [x] More backpropagation

Wednesday

- [x] Makemore: Wavenet

Thursday

- [x] Transformer implementation (nanogpt)
